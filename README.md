# Blog Website

This Blog Website is a modern, fully responsive web application designed to provide an elegant and engaging reading experience. Built with React (Vite + TypeScript), it leverages the latest front-end technologies such as Tailwind CSS v4 for styling, Radix UI for accessible UI primitives, and a component-driven architecture for scalability.
This project serves as a robust template for content-driven platforms, making it suitable for personal blogs, tech publications, company updates, or knowledge-sharing platforms. The design emphasizes clarity, readability, and user interaction, featuring a clean layout with sections for featured articles, latest posts, category filters, and a sidebar for additional content or widgets.
